# Photo-Album_React
A photo album created using Material UI and React.

The actual app lives inside of /photo_album_app, which includes its own readme instructions.

There are some imports that may not have been used. They are defined because the project should be using them soon.

For good coding practice, you should never have any unused imports lingering in files.
