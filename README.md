# Photo-Album_React
A photo album created using Material UI and React.

The actual app lives inside of /photo_album_app which includes it's own ReadMe instructions.

Learned using tutorials.
There are some imports that may not have been used. They are deifined because the project should be using them soon. 

For good coding practice, you should never have any unused imports lingering in files.
